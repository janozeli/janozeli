- ⚡ Fun fact: Throughout my entire life, I always thought of technology as just a hobby. I tried three different college majors in the Humanities before being recruited by the Brazilian Army (against my will, as we have compulsory military conscription here in Brazil). Having had some prior experience with technology, I was assigned to assist in writing documentation using LibreOffice. Interestingly, nearly all the computers there ran Linux distributions, which required me to learn the system and specific tools for my day-to-day tasks. This demand made me reevaluate my career path. After that year, I decided to become a tech student.
